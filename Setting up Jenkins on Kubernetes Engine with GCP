1.setup your system and Activate Cloud shell 

gcloud auth list

~authorize.

~~ You can list the project ID with this command:
gcloud config list projetc


Task 1. Prepare the environment

~~ Set the default Compute Engine zone to us-east1-b :

gcloud config set compute/zone us-east1-b


~~ Clone the sample code:

git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/continuous-deployment-on-kubernetes.git

~~ Navigate to the sample code directory:

cd continuous-deployment-on-kubernetes

## Creating a Kubernetes cluster

~~ Next, provision a Kubernetes cluster using Kubernetes Engine. This step can take several minutes to complete:

gcloud container clusters create jenkins-cd \
--num-nodes 2 \
--scopes "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/projecthosting,cloud-platform"

~~ Confirm that your cluster is running:


gcloud container clusters list

~~ Get the credentials for your cluster. Kubernetes Engine uses these credentials to access your newly provisioned cluster.

gcloud container clusters get-credentials jenkins-cd

~~ Confirm that you can connect to your cluster:

kubectl cluster-info

Task 2. Configure Helm

~~ Add Helm's jenkins chart repository:

helm repo add jenkins https://charts.jenkins.io

~~ Update the repo to ensure you get the latest list of charts:
helm repo update


Task 3. Configure and install Jenkins

~~ Use the Helm CLI to deploy the chart with your configuration set:

helm upgrade --install -f jenkins/values.yaml myjenkins jenkins/jenkins

~~ Once that command completes ensure the Jenkins pod goes to the Running state and the container is in the READY state. This may take about 2 minutes:

kubectl get pods

~~Run the following command to setup port forwarding to the Jenkins UI from the Cloud Shell:

echo http://127.0.0.1:8080
kubectl --namespace default port-forward svc/myjenkins 8080:8080 >> /dev/null &

~~Now, check that the Jenkins Service was created properly:

kubectl get svc


Task 4. Connect to Jenkins

~~ The Jenkins chart will automatically create an admin password for you. To retrieve it, run:

kubectl exec --namespace default -it svc/myjenkins -c jenkins -- /bin/cat /run/secrets/additional/chart-admin-password && echo
