gcloud auth list

~authorize.

~~ You can list the project ID with this command:
gcloud config list projetc


Task 1. Prepare the environment

~~ Set the default Compute Engine zone to us-east1-b :

gcloud config set compute/zone us-east1-b


~~ Clone the sample code:

git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/continuous-deployment-on-kubernetes.git

~~ Navigate to the sample code directory:

cd continuous-deployment-on-kubernetes

## Creating a Kubernetes cluster

~~ Next, provision a Kubernetes cluster using Kubernetes Engine. This step can take several minutes to complete:

gcloud container clusters create jenkins-cd \
--num-nodes 2 \
--scopes "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/projecthosting,cloud-platform"

~~ Confirm that your cluster is running:

gcloud container clusters list

~~ Get the credentials for your cluster. Kubernetes Engine uses these credentials to access your newly provisioned cluster.

gcloud container clusters get-credentials jenkins-cd

~~ Confirm that you can connect to your cluster:

kubectl cluster-info

Task 2. Configure Helm

~~ Add Helm's jenkins chart repository:

helm repo add jenkins https://charts.jenkins.io
